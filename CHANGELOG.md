| /api/edgeos/list           | GET    | List all the endpoints available (supporting multiple integrations), available once for integration |
| /api/edgeos/{ENTRY_ID}/ha  | GET    | JSON of all HA processed data before sent to entities including messages counters, per integration  |
| /api/edgeos/{ENTRY_ID}/api | GET    | JSON of all raw data from the EdgeOS API, per integration                                           |
| /api/edgeos/{ENTRY_ID}/ws  | GET    | JSON of all raw data from the EdgeOS WebSocket, per integration                                     |

Component refactored to allow faster future integration for additional features.

New features:

- Enable / Disable interface (Ethernet / Bridge) using a new switch per interface
- Enable / Disable interface monitoring for received and sent data / rate / errors / packets and dropped packets using a switch per interface
- Enable / Disable device monitoring for received and sent data and rate (including device tracker) using a switch per interface
- Enable / Disable store debug data to `./storage` directory of HA for API (`edgeos.debug.api.json`) and WS (`edgeos.debug.ws.json`) data for faster debugging or just to get more ideas for additional features
- Firmware Update binary sensor including link to the new firmware
- Warning when prerequisites of traffic analysis (DPI and Export) are not turned on
- Asynchronous data updates of API and WebSocket to handle disconnection better
- New service: `Update configuration` allows to edit configuration of unit, store debug data, log incoming messages and consider away interval

**Breaking Changes!**

- Most of the configurations moved to be regular components of HA (Log incoming messages, Unit of measurement, Store debug data)
- Configuration UI will hold EdgeOS URL and credentials only:
  - Hostname
  - Port
  - Username
  - Password
