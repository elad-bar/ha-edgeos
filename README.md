# EdgeOS

## Description

Provides an integration between EdgeOS (Ubiquiti) routers to Home Assistant.

[Changelog](https://github.com/elad-bar/ha-edgeos/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## How to

#### Requirements

- EdgeRouter with at least firmware version 2.0
- EdgeRouter User with 'Operator' level access or higher
- Traffic Analysis set to 'Enabled' (both `dpi` and `export` enabled under `system/traffic-analysis`)
- To enable / disable interfaces an `admin` role is a required

#### Installations via HACS

- In HACS, look for "Ubiquiti EdgeOS Routers" and install and restart
- In Settings --> Devices & Services - (Lower Right) "Add Integration"

#### Setup

To add integration use Configuration -> Integrations -> Add `EdgeOS`
Integration supports **multiple** EdgeOS devices

| Fields name | Type    | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                                      |

| Host        | Textbox | +        | -       | Hostname or IP address to access EdgeOS device, can hold also port (HOST:PORT), default port is 443                                              |
| Username    | Textbox | +        | -       | Username of user with `Operator` level access or higher, better to create a dedicated user for that integration for faster issues identification |
| Password    | Textbox | +        | -       |                                                                                                                                                  |

###### EdgeOS Device validation errors

| General authentication error (when failed to get valid response from device)       |
| Could not retrieve device data from EdgeOS Router                                  |
| Export (traffic-analysis) configuration is disabled, please enable                 |
| Deep Packet Inspection (traffic-analysis) configuration is disabled, please enable |
| Unsupported firmware version                                                       |

###### Encryption key got corrupted

If a persistent notification popped up with the following message:

```
Encryption key got corrupted, please remove the integration and re-add it
```

It means that encryption key was modified from outside the code,
Please remove the integration and re-add it to make it work again.

_Unit of measurement for `Traffic` and `Rate` are according to the unit settings of the integration_

## Services

### Update configuration

Allows to set:

- Consider away interval - Time to consider a device without activity as AWAY (any value between 10 and 1800 in seconds)
- Log incoming messages - Enable / Disable logging of incoming WebSocket messages for debug
- Store debug data - Enable / Disable store debug data to './storage' directory of HA for API (edgeos.debug.api.json) and WS (edgeos.debug.ws.json) data for faster debugging or just to get more ideas for additional features
- Unit of measurement
- Update API interval - Interval in seconds to update API data
- Update Entities interval - Interval in seconds to update entities

More details available in `Developer tools` -> `Services` -> `edgeos.update_configuration`

```yaml
service: edgeos.update_configuration
data:
  device_id: { Main device ID }
  unit: Bytes
  log_incoming_messages: true
  consider_away_interval: 180
  update_api_interval: 30
  update_entities_interval: 1
```
